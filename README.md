### Configuration
Add these lines in kibana.yml. Generally, the kibana.yml can be found at 	
`/etc/kibana`.
```
csp.rules:
  # current defaults
  - "script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-{nonce}'"
  - "worker-src blob'"
  - "child-src blob:"
  # New rule for iframes

```
Register at [https://ai.query.ai/cloud](https://ai.query.ai/cloud)
**Note:** The lines above are telling the Kibana's content security policy that [https://ai.query.ai/](https://ai.query.ai/) is a safe website to load javascript from. Without adding the above lines, the Kibana plugin wonâ€™t work. Your data stays between your browser and your Elastic stack. NLP translation of your questions to search syntax happens via our cloud APIs. Please contact help@query.ai for any assistance or further information.
